# Video-Recordings-of-Reward-Structures-for-Robotic-Locomotion-Tasks-using-PPO
This repository contains video recordings referenced in the Research Report: Reward Structures for Robotic Locomotion Tasks using Proximal Policy Optimization by Gabriel Tidy

Video recordings are of select runs using the non-Baseline primitive and combined reward structures. Runs for each reward type showcase the typical locomotive behaviour produced by that reward, specifically with relation to their speed and stability.
